# 🧭 Edify-AI — Google Maps for a Student’s Career

> Students don’t fail because they lack talent.  
> They fail because they don’t know the route.

**Edify-AI** is a personalized AI career advisor that guides students from *confusion to clarity* — just like Google Maps guides you from source to destination.

Instead of scattered courses, random advice, and generic resumes, Edify-AI provides **direction, guidance, and continuous correction** throughout a student’s career journey.

## 🚨 The Problem

Today’s students:
- Don’t know **what to learn next**
- Open 50 tabs, watch random tutorials
- Buy courses that don’t match their level
- Apply to jobs without understanding the role
- Fail interviews despite knowing the basics

The issue is **not effort** — it’s **lack of direction**.

Students don’t need more platforms.  
They need **one intelligent system that connects everything**.

## 🗺️ The Idea: Google Maps for a Career

Just like Google Maps answers:
- Where am I?
- Where do I want to go?
- What’s the best route?
- What if I take a wrong turn?

Edify-AI does the same — but for careers.

## 🧩 Core Journey (The Story)

### 🧭 Step 1: Destination & Path (Career Roadmap)
We analyze:
- Resume
- Skills
- Interests
- Career goals
- Job market context

Then generate a **personalized career roadmap** — not generic trends, but a path tailored to *that student*.

> “You don’t wander anymore. You follow a route.”

---

### 📚 Step 2: Learning the Route (AI Course Generation)
For each step in the roadmap, we generate **custom learning modules**:
- Curated YouTube content
- Hands-on coding environments
- Quizzes & checkpoints
- Concept reinforcement

No overwhelming catalogs.  
Only what’s required for *this step*.

---

### 🚗 Step 3: Preparing the Vehicle (Resume Builder)
A great route is useless if your vehicle isn’t ready.

Edify-AI builds **job-specific, context-aware resumes**:
- Tailored to the exact job description
- Optimized for ATS & recruiters
- Dynamically updated as skills improve

One job → one resume → automatically.

---

### 🎤 Step 4: Reaching the Destination (Mock Interviews)
Most students fail at the final turn — interviews.

Our AI mock interviews:
- Are built from the student’s resume + job description
- Simulate real interview pressure
- Evaluate content, clarity, confidence, and delivery
- Provide actionable feedback

If the student isn’t ready, the system **reroutes** — not rejects.

---

### 🧠 The Glue: One Intelligent Assistant (MCP)
All features are connected through a single **AI assistant** powered by MCP.

You can:
- Ask for guidance
- Generate courses
- Fix resumes
- Start mock interviews
- Track progress

The system remembers context and adapts continuously.

> This is not a tool.  
> This is a personal career mentor.
